Goals for agkozak-zsh-theme v3.0.0
==================================

# Macros
- Come up with names for ternary conditions and work into parser
- Rewrite how parser errors are generated
- Simplify the output of built-in functions and "macroize" them so that people can see how to customize them
- Examples of how to write themes with macros and perhaps even custom functions

# Other customizations
- Provide global associative array for Git branch status symbols
- Allow two global strings to override the default prompts entirely
- Add a function to precmd to check for changes to customizations and themes and switch on the fly
- Add a few default themes (perhaps an agkozak2 without right prompt and "impure")
- See GitHub pull request for other customization ideas

# Marketing
- Refer to the project as a prompt, not a theme, throughout. Consider changing the repo name, etc.
